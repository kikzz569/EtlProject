# üìä ETL Ads Performance Project

This project is a **two-step Streamlit application** designed for validating and visualizing **advertising performance data** through an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline.

It includes:
1. **Data Validation App (`validate_app.py`)** ‚Äî checks CSV files using a Pydantic data model.
2. **Performance Dashboard (`dashboard_app.py`)** ‚Äî builds an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and insights.

## üöÄ Overview

The goal of this project is to **validate marketing campaign data** and generate **interactive insights** such as:
- Spending and conversion trends  
- Lead performance by day of the week  
- CPA (Cost per Acquisition) distribution  
- Top-performing AdSets and creatives  

It ensures the data structure is consistent **before visualization**, preventing incorrect metrics or dashboard errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation (`validate_app.py`)
- The user uploads a **CSV file** (e.g. ad performance data).
- Each row is validated against the schema defined in `validator.py`.
- Validation checks include:
  - Required fields  
  - Numeric formats (float, int)  
  - Non-negative values (`Amount_spent >= 0`)
- The app returns:
  - Total records processed  
  - Valid vs invalid counts  
  - Detailed error report with row and field names  

When all data passes validation, the CSV can be safely used in the dashboard.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Visualization (`dashboard_app.py`)
- The user uploads the **validated CSV**.
- The app:
  - Fills missing values for `Conversions` and `Amount_spent`
  - Calculates **CPA** (Cost per Acquisition)
  - Aggregates metrics by month, weekday, and AdSet
  - Displays KPIs and six interactive charts using Plotly
